He performed well above the other freelancers we had working on the project. I admire his dedication to sales and his constant effort to improve his work product and his skillset. 

It is a shame that our program ended because I would have loved to keep Floyd on. I will continue to look for opportunities to hire Floyd in the future. Best of luck Floyd and thank you for all of your work!!"
