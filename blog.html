    <h5 class='text-center'>Why Salespeople Today Have Less People Skills Then Their Non-Selling Grand Parents</h5>

    <p>Sales is a people based profession. A person who is good with people usually finds the adjustment to a sales career easier than people who don't. But being good with people is not based on "skills" a lone, it's based on having the internal resources
      that most people get from childhood by being raised in large families with nurturing environments that gave ample opportunities to practice communicating with different people of different ages. It's being raised in a wholesome environment that
      let them develop their own personality being guided by the adults who help them transition from child to confident adult.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, most people didn't grow up in such an environment in fact if you were born after world war 2 you were probably raised to be a teenager and not the young man or young woman your grandfather or grandmother were raised to be. They spent
      less time playing video games, watching tv, being child and they most likely didn't know of the concept of being a teenager if they where over the age of 19 by the end of world war 2 becuase the word didn't become known until then. This resulted
      in them being raised in a people focused society gave more opportuniteis too practice "people skills" and by default became better people persons. The book by Dr. Michael Platt Myth Of The Teenager is a great resource on this.</p>

    <p>Just think about the difference between thier generation and how our generation deals with, views and expirence things like child rearing, role models, the generation gap, family life, videos games, the role of modern entertainment and pop culture
      on the mind, manners and internal being of a person.It's undeniable that the way most of us were raised today and the way our grandparents were raised was different and our "people skills" have been affected. People skills and sales skills are part
      of a toolbox that a person needs to flourish in the sales industry.</p>

    <p>What if we didn't get this gift of "people skills" growing up for one reason or another? Well, we develop ourselves to get what's missing. In summary, feeling good and comfortable as we interact with lot's of different types of strangers who feel
      good and comfortable from working with us is the sure way to success in this industry. I highlight "feeling good and comfortable" as we do it.</p>

    <p>I find that a lot of times people who want to have more people skills without truly becoming a better person will come across as contrived. Learning tools like mirroring people, listening skills, and other techniques are important, but if a person
      doesn't truly feel good, feel confident, feel presentable and feel respectable, it will be hard to benefit from techniques on people skills and they will never truly feel like the alpha male most seek to be.</p>

    <p>In the sales profession or at least in the view of many hiring managers, to be a dominant, confident, aggressive and a highly competitive person is considered desirable traits of inside sales professional. To be a real life alpha male is the goal
      of many people in or out of the sales profession. In the sale profession, salesmen don't just want to deal with people, they want to be influential, persuasive, confident and emotionally detached from outcomes but give the feeling to their prospect
      that they care about them at the same time. This is not an easy thing. Many sales people in at least one point in their career wanted to be the "boss", the alpha male who is attractive to others, is sure of themselves and has control over their
      environment and the people in it. </p>

    <p>Who can blame them, in the animal kingdom where we get the concept of the alpha male, the alpha male get's the most mates to mate with. They get the most meat and the most respect from others. The problem is being an alpha, and sustaining as a male
      in the human world takes a lot more than just dominance.</p>

    <p>First of all, dominance is a short-term strategy and secondly each person needs their own definition of what an alpha male truly is to them. It takes redefining what an alpha male is and comparing that to the self-image a person has of themselves
      as a healthy way to fill the gap between the two. The last thing we want to do is have people chase a shadow that can't be reached.
    </p>

    <p>For example in a study by Dr Scott Kaufman who teaches at University of Pennsylvania, found that traits like dominance, aggressiveness, being demanding and being a person who is always ready to fight his way to the top is not the man most woman find
      attractive, after all fighting your way to the top and maintain what your gain while remaining happy are two different things. It's parallel to the workplace, most aggressive, demanding self-centered people can only function as an island for only
      so long until co-workers rebel against them.
    </p>

    <p>Dr Scott found assertiveness and sensitivity are what most women find attractive. Assertive and sensitive are two traits of a prestigious person who possesses leadership qualities that earn the honor and respect of others instead of trying to take
      it. It's not an act to be prestigious and it feels good to live a prestigious life. This is true in the workplace and relationships as well, assertive people who can advocate for themselves but make others feel important or at least heard gain trust
      and respect. That was basically the gist of the famous book "How to win friends and influence people".
    </p>
    <p>
      Author Tom Hopkins pretty much summarizes that there are two types of sales professionals. (A) those who realize that they must constantly be swimming ahead by constantly practicing, reading and learning. (B) Those who float by just going through their
      company's training program or their client's sales process not trying to apply themselves to do more and become great.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll assume you're type A who understands that there is no floating by and understands the constant need of improvement.Most of the problems with sales professionals who are low performers who are not being consistent with their numbers, despite being
      people who study their craft, work hard and know the technology they're selling very well is usually because of a mixture of 3 reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. They don't have a rock solid positive self-image.They may have cracks in their self-esteem(self-worth) or self-confidence(belief in one's ability) because of experiences they have gone through. Others sense it, and it has negative effects on a person,
      in their sales career and normal life until they go after this enemy of the self. These people many times feel the opposite of an alpha male. 2. They are not exploiting obvious opportunities in their companies sales system as an easy way to gain
      more sales. These obvious opportunities are not taught in a company's training program they need to be noticed, discovered and exploited. 3. They are not able to implement knowledge that they have gained over the course of thier sales career on
      the spot anywhere near the level that skilled freestyle rapper can effortlessly say the right thing in the right context. Sure some us read scripts but customers don't care about our scritps they want the call to go where they are intrested in taking
      it.
    </p>

      A salesperson with low-self esteem or negative self-image will fall into a rut eventually no matter how hard they act to be otherwise. Positive affirmations won't work and the negative results of this will show up in other parts of the person's life as
      well. It's not all about feeling comfortable in ones' own skin, it's also about being aware and dynamic in changing scenarios. It's good to use tools to change one's' state to perform better like sitting straight, shoulders back and smile, but this
      is only useful in conjunction with actual internal change. When a person is whole, mentally healthy, and strong, the sales techniques and lessons learned from various sources will be unlocked and easy to implement, and this will have a major impact
      on the inside sales professional's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sales professional is a person who uses psychology to increase the chances of him helping someone to accept something that they can use that he/she is offering. If the salesperson isn't growing in his love life, family life and social life then it's
      proof he is not benefiting from his sales knowledge. A salesperson should by default be improving and not just reading about improving because he should be a master at getting what he/she wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give me a farm boy who was raised in a wholesome environment that helped him to develop into a young man and not a teenager with a strong sense of self, who is confident despite his flaws with average or slightly below average speaking ability with no
      education and I'll show you someone who will run rings around the highly educated but internally flawed salesperson every day of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find the lessions I learned working as a addiction counselor/life coach is applicable to sales coaching. When a person has a trait that is self destructive they need to deal with what is causing them to sabotage themselves and work a recovery plan that
      they can live according to. Anything else will come up short.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sales meeting throught the globe sales managers are dumbfounded on why certain agents struggle and others don't when they get the same sales training, and motivationsl talks. It's becuase many of them need counsling & life coaching to improve their
      self-image which will drasticly improve their people skills. After that, the techniques, leads and motivational talks will make that person flurish.
